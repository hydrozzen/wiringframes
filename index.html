        <p class="firstlefpara">It’s used to describe someone as being foolish or scatterbrained. But birds are far from foolish! Their 
            behaviours are tremendously diverse, and all are meant to ensure their survival. Let’s learn some wisdom 
            from the birds of the world – at the Wild Wisdom Global Challenge 2023!</p>

            <p class="secondparalef">People around the world have long been fascinated by these creatures of the air, with eagles, doves, and other 
                birds inspiring art, poetry, and music, and birds like cranes, falcons and parrots found in ancient cave 
                paintings, Egyptian pyramids, and other historical monuments.</p>

                bar-tailed godwit in 2022. It 
                flew around 13560 kms

      <h1 class="birdsre">Birds are the pulse of the planet</h1>
      <p class="birdpulse">Birds are widespread, easy to identify and count, and responsive to changes in their 
        environments. Changes in bird numbers and distribution can reflect trends in ecosystems, 
        making these animals excellent ecological indicators. Changes in the bird populations are often 
        the first indication of environmental problems.</p>
